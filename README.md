# todoodles

## Project Description

Todoodles is a traditional todo web app that allows the user to strike-through a completed list item. Please note: you'd be crazy to actually use this app to manage your todos...user authorization has not been set up so all users have access to the same list. I created this project to practice setting up a front end that consumes data from a back end API.
